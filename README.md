# Amazon Vine Analysis Using AWS RDS, SQL pgAdmin, and Pandas

## Overview of Amazon Vine Analysis

### Purpose
Analyzing Amazon reviews written by Vine program members using a database of musical instruments, this project seeks to determine whether Vine members are biased toward positive reviews.

## Results

### Reviews on Vine and off Vine

- Reviews on Total Vine



- Reviews by Non-Vine



### Reviews with 5 Star 

- Review totals for Vine 5-stars


- Non-Vine reviews totaling 5-stars


### The percentage of 5 Star Reviews

- Reviews on Vine with 5 stars, as a percentage



- Reviews with 5 stars from sources other than VIne


## Summary of Results
According to the results of the analysis, Vine does not exhibit any positivity bias. Both Vine and Non-Vine reviews have a 5-star average of 57%, which supports our conclusion. If we wish to compare Vine program reviews with non-Vine program reviews, it might be useful to have a summary statistic which includes the mean,median,mode,minimum values, and standard deviation.
